Questions regarding the visualisation itself:

1. What do you see ?
	- What does each color means ?
	- What are the circles ?
	- What are the arrows ?
	- What does the thickness of the arrow mean ?
	- What are the grey circles ?

2. Observed patterns:
	- Do you see patterns or outliers in the graphs ? If so, point them out.
	- Can you find a meaning for at least one of the pattern ? Explain it.

3. Informations:
	- Other than the patterns, do you find the information given by the graph interesting ? Does it seem correct to you ?

4. Old version:
	- Do you think this conveys the same information as what you saw previously ?
	- Could you find the information we talked about earlier (patterns, names of nodes, changes in probabilities) in this version of the graphs ? Can you estimate how much longer (or how much faster) it would take you to find that same information on this longer graph.
	- Are there things you could find on this (old version) of the graph that are easier to find / understand / interpret than on the earlier more compact graphs?
	- Do you see an improvement from this to the more compact graphs ?

5: Overall and features:
	- Do you think this visualisation is a clear representation of changes in a process ?
	- Would you make any changes to make it clearer ? Wich ones ?
	- Is there a feature that you would really want to add to the compact visualisation ?
		- Content-wise 
		- Regarding the visual aspect
		- Regarding the dynamics of the visualisation
		- Regarding how to interact with the visualisation

Questions regarding the visualisation in the context of performing a redelivery
6. Observed patterns, continued
	- Do the patterns you see make sense with your "migration expertise" ?
	- Did you expect some patterns that are not present here ?

7. Informations, continued
	- Other than the patterns, do you find the information given by the graph useful in your work ?
	- Could you get the same information without the visualisation ? If so, would it be difficult ? Describe how you would go about it.
	- Does the visualisation show information that you wouldn't have thought about getting ?
	- Could the information from the visualisation (patterns included) be useful in your work in regards to:
		- Understanding (would it make understanding what changed easier) ?
		- Efficency (would make some of the steps faster/easier) ?
		- Communication (would make communication to the client easier) ?
		- Other ?

8. Features, continued
	- Regarding your redelivery work specifically, is there a feature that you would really want to add to the compact visualisation ?
		- Content-wise 
		- Regarding the visual aspect
		- Regarding the dynamics of the visualisation
		- Regarding how to interact with the visualisation
	- Are there changes you would make to what is currently there ? Why ?
	- Would adding the features you thought about change your answers to the question about this visualisation making your work more efficient, the communication or the understanding easier ? If so, how ? 
	- Could this visualisation be useful in another context than the one of a redelivery ? How ?

	- What do you like/dislike about this visualisation ? Both in the context of a redelivery or in general.
	- Anything else you'd like to add ?
